## Description

A NestJS based application for managing some annoyances in my fantasty hockey keeper league.  The league has rules regarding maximum games played limits for players I have drafted and/or signed and it's entirely managed on a old school bulletin board platform.  So this app helps me monitor and track those thresholds for the given list of players.

## Built With

## Support

This is a personal project with a very particular use case and therefore I do not offer any support.  If you're in my league, congratulations, you found my secret sauce.  Good luck getting it to work for you. :)
